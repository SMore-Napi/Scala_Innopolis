# Introduction to FP and Scala
## Assignment 2
In this assignment you can get up to 105 pt, however, if you get more than 100 pt, extra points will be dropped, and you will be awarded with 100 pt. Tasks with additional points are marked with (*). 

The purpose of this assignment is to get acquainted with the List data structure and use pattern matching for solving a toy example.

> **Warning**
> NEVER push your code to the main branch! Instead, create a new branch (`git checkout -b solutions`), add and push your code there (`git push origin solutions`) and then open a pull request from the new branch to the main branch. This is the only way.

> **Note**
> If you see something you do not know, google its documentation.
### Task 1 [60 pt + 5 extra]
[30 pt + 5 extra] Go to Task 1 folder and implement the necessary functions for the List

[30 pt] Write tests for the list functions. Do not use extremely long lists for the tests (check an extra task why)

### Task 2 [40 pt]
[30 pt] Implement a simple Building, using knowledge of ADT from the lab. A building should have an address and a link to the floors. A floor can be either Residential floor (2 people live in it) or an Attic floor (No people live in it, there are no floors above them). Residents of the building must have age and sex (male or female). Technical details can be found in task2 folder

[10 pt] Write tests only for countOldManFloors, womenMaxAge. This will suffice.
